# Computercraft scripts  <img src="http://www.computercraft.info/wiki/images/d/da/Ccblink.gif" width="40px">

In this repository I'll add a few of my computercraft lua scripts for miscellaneous things.  
Every folder in the repository contains a script along with a README explaining what the script does and how to use it.

### What is ComputerCraft?
[ComputerCraft](http://www.computercraft.info/) is a Minecraft mod created by [Dan200](http://www.computercraft.info/dan200/).  
This repository is not afiliated with the ComputerCraft Minecraft mod or Dan200 more than that it uses the ComputerCraft APIs created by Dan200 and the ComputerCraft community.
